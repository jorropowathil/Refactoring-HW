# Project Details
* This project required me to refactor code. I was able to  minimize the amount of code in style.css and was able to simplify index.html as well. This was done in conjunction with improving functionality of the site as shown below: 
    * All links in the nav bar are now working properly
    * Accessibility was increased by adding alt tags to images 
    * Minimized the number of classes and IDs for ease in future editing
    * Changed non-semantic html elements to semantic
